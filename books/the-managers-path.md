## Management 101

The chapter describes what you should expect from a good manager.

### One-on-one meetings

**1-1s allow human connection.** Letting your manager into your life is important, because when there are stressful things happening, it will be easier to ask for time off. Your manager should treat you like a human that has a life outside work.

**An opportunity to speak privetely.** 1-1s shoud be predictably scheduled so that you could plan the agenda.

### Feedback

**Delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something.** The sooner you know about your bad habits, the sooner they are to correct.

**Praise should be public and criticism should be private.** Praising in public is considered to be a best practice because it shows what positive behavior looks like.

### Training and career growth

A manager holds some responsibility for finding resources for career growth. Mostly you are responsible for figuring out what types of training you want.
If the company has a promoution process, your manager will be involved in it in some fashion.

### You are responsible for yourself

Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want.
When you want to work on a project, ask. When you are persistently unhappy, speak out. You will not get everything you want, and asking is not fun, but it's the fastest way forward.

### Give your manager a break

**A manager's job is to do the best thing for the company and the team, not to do whatever it takes to make you happy.**
The only person you can change is yourself. Your manager expect you to bring solutions, not problems.

### Choose your managers wisely

Consider not only the job, the company and the pay, but also the manager when evaluating job opportunities. Strong managers have strong networks, and they can get you jobs even after you stop working for them.
