## Management 101

The chapter describes what you should expect from a good manager.

### One-on-one meetings

**1-1s allow human connection.** Letting your manager into your life is important, because when there are stressful things happening, it will be easier to ask for time off. Your manager should treat you like a human that has a life outside work.

**An opportunity to speak privetely.** 1-1s shoud be predictably scheduled so that you could plan the agenda.

### Feedback

**Delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something.** The sooner you know about your bad habits, the sooner they are to correct.

**Praise should be public and criticism should be private.** Praising in public is considered to be a best practice because it shows what positive behavior looks like.
